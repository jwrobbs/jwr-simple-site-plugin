# JWR *simple* site plugin
## Update
I built my systems to work with a system based on custom post types. That feels like over kill. Or I'm delaying actually putting content on the site.

## Goal
The goal is to use GitHub for version control of a WordPress plugin that I'm using for all my custom functions.

## Execution
1. Clone repo - done
2. Comment out each file
3. Reactivate them 1 at at time after updating it

## Notes
I use a VS Code extension named ToDo Tree. It lets me use my comments for other functions. I'll add a legend eventually.

## Requirements
I use ACF Pro a lot. Currently, that is the only requirement.
